## üöÄ I'm a JavaScript and Solidity developer

I work on the Frontend and I'm learning how to develop on the Backend. I am dedicated to creating webpages with dynamism and interactivity using JavaScript, as well as user interfaces with React.js. Also, I create smart contracts, DApps, DNFTs and protocolos. I am an eternal student, curious, collaborator, Blockchain and cryptographic enthusiast. I'm Co-Founder of [**dotlabs()**](https://dotlabs-workshops-calendar.vercel.app/), a community of web developers passionate about Blockchain technology. Our goal is to increase the adoption of such technology through teaching. 

When I am not working, I study, read, learn, teach, give talks, conduct classes and worshops, spread valuable information and contribute to the Web3 and Web2 development communities.
